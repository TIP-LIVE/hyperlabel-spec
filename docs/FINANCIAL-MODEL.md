## Appendix: Assumptions & Sources

### Revenue Assumptions

| Assumption | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Rationale |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Labels sold | 20,000 | 50,000 | 200,000 | 2.5x Y1→Y2 (paid acquisition), 4x Y2→Y3 (scaled channels) |
| ASP | $22.00 | $25.00 | $25.50 | Mix shift toward multi-label packs and enterprise |
| Customer repeat rate | 40% | 55% | 65% | Based on B2B hardware repurchase benchmarks |
| New customers | 500 | 1,500 | 6,000 | CAC efficiency improves with brand awareness |

**Year 1 → Year 2 Growth Drivers (2.5x):**
- Year 1 builds strong customer base with $100K marketing budget
- Year 2 adds scaled paid acquisition ($120K budget)
- First case studies enable faster sales cycles
- Word-of-mouth from 500+ customers
- Estimated 1,500 new customers × 2.0 orders/year × 17 labels/order = 50K labels

### Cost Assumptions

| Component | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Driver |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Hardware | $10.00 | $9.00 | $8.70 | Volume pricing: 25K→60K→220K MOQ |
| softSIM | $0.50 | $0.50 | $0.50 | Onomondo softSIM flat rate |
| Packaging | $0.50 | $0.40 | $0.30 | Bulk printing + simplified design |

*Shipping is charged separately to the customer.*

**Manufacturing Cost Reduction Basis:**
- Shenzhen EMS quotes: $10.00 at 20K units, $9.00 at 50K, $8.70 at 200K+
- Applied 10% buffer for quality/rework
- Volume pricing confirmed with 2 manufacturers (quotes on file)

### Personnel Cost Assumptions

| Role | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Engineering | $70K (1 FTE) | $160K (2 FTE) | $280K (4 FTE) | Y1: 1 FTE engineer at $70K; Y2+: scaling team |
| Sales/Marketing | $30K (0.5 FTE) | $60K (1 FTE) | $120K (2 FTE) | Founder-led Y1, hired Y2+ |
| Operations | $10K (0.5 FTE) | $30K (1 FTE) | $50K (1 FTE) | Part-time ops Y1 |

*Note: Year 1 assumes founders contributing as part of their equity commitment plus 1 FTE engineer. Salary costs increase from Year 2 as full-time hires replace contractor roles. Founder salaries begin at seed close.*

### Market Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Source |
|------------|-------|--------|
| TAM (cargo tracking) | $18B | MarketsandMarkets "Real-Time Location Systems Market" 2024 |
| Market CAGR | 11.8% | MarketsandMarkets 2024-2030 forecast |
| SMB segment | 10% of TAM | Estimated based on Tive/Roambee enterprise focus |
| Cross-border e-commerce growth | 14.5% YoY | Statista 2024 |

### Key Risks to Projections

| Risk | Impact on Model | Mitigation |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Slower adoption | Revenue 50% below target | Conservative base case; bear scenario modeled |
| Manufacturing delays | 2-3 month revenue shift | 2-batch inventory strategy |
| Higher CAC | Lower profitability | $150 CAC ceiling built into model |
| Competitor price war | Margin compression | COGS reduction roadmap provides buffer |

# TIP — Investor Teaser

**Smart Tracking Labels for the $18B Cargo Visibility Market**

---

## The Problem

**$15-25B** lost annually to cargo theft, delays, and misrouted shipments.¹ Current tracking solutions cost $100-500 per device, require complex setup, and lock customers into carrier-specific platforms — leaving SMB shippers with near-zero visibility during international transit.

> "I ship $50K of electronics from Shenzhen to London. If something goes wrong, I find out too late."

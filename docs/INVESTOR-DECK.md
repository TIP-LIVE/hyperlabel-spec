**Seed Round | Q1 2026**

## Slide 1: Title

# TIP

### Track Any Cargo, Anywhere

**$20 Smart Tracking Labels for the $18B Cargo Visibility Market**

*Seed Round: $500K*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Three Critical Problems in Cargo Visibility

**1. Consignee Problem: "Where is my cargo?"**
- Buyers and receivers have zero visibility during international transit
- Cargo goes "dark" during flights, ocean transit, and remote areas
- 68% of SMB shippers report limited or no visibility (Freightos SMB Survey 2024)

**2. Shipper Problem: Communication Breakdown**
- Freight forwarders provide updates every 3-4 days at best
- No real-time status sharing between parties
- When problems occur, stakeholders find out too late

> "I ship $50K worth of electronics from China. My forwarder updates me every 3-4 days. If something goes wrong, I find out too late." — Amazon FBA Seller

**3. Environmental Tracking: Carbon Footprint Gap**
- No standardized way to track per-shipment carbon footprint
- ESG reporting requirements increasing globally (CSRD, SEC climate rules)
- Supply chain emissions represent 60%+ of total corporate emissions

**Result:** $15B+ lost annually to cargo theft, delays, and misrouted shipments

## Slide 3: The Solution

### A $20 Tracking Label That Just Works

| Enterprise Trackers | TIP |
|---------------------|-----|
| $70-500 per device | $22 per label |
| Bulky, reusable | 3.5mm thin, disposable |
| Complex IT setup | Scan, peel, stick |
| Carrier-dependent | 180+ countries |
| Basic GPS only | AI route intelligence |

**How it works:**
```
Buy → Peel & Stick → Track Anywhere → Confirm Delivery
```

---

## Slide 4: Product Demo

### Simple as 1-2-3

**1. Order labels online** — Ships to you in 3-5 days

**2. Scan QR & attach** — Activates instantly, no app needed

**3. Track everywhere** — Real-time map, alerts, shareable link

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity

### $18B Market, Underserved SMB Segment

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **TAM** | $18B | MarketsandMarkets 2024 |
| **SAM** | $1.8B | SMB segment (10% of TAM) |
| **SOM Year 1** | $440K | 20,000 labels sold |
| **SOM Year 3** | $5.1M | 200,000 labels |

**Why Now:**
- softSIM costs down 60-70% since 2020 (GSMA)
- LTE Cat-1 coverage: 180+ countries
- 47% of supply chain leaders prioritize visibility (Gartner 2023)

---

## Slide 6: Business Model

### Hardware Sales with Expanding Margins

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| ASP | $22.00 | $25.50 |
| COGS/label | $11.00 | $9.50 |
| **Gross Margin** | **50%** | **63%** |

**Margin improvement drivers:**
- Manufacturing volume: 20K → 200K labels
- softSIM flat-rate pricing
- Shipping charged separately

**Unit Economics (Year 3):**
- CAC: $33
- LTV: $350 (single-order) / $750+ (with repeat purchases*)
- LTV:CAC: **10.6x** (single-order) / **22.7x** (with repeat*)

*\*Conservative repeat assumption: 1.5 orders/customer/year, 2-year lifespan*

## Slide 8: Competitive Landscape

### Low Price + Consumer Simplicity

```
                    HIGH PRICE
                        │
     Sensitech ●        │        ● Controlant
        $300            │            $400
                        │
     Roambee ●          │        ● Tive
        $200            │          $150
                        │
    ────────────────────┼────────────────────
    COMPLEX             │            SIMPLE
                        │
     Sensos ●           │        ★ TIP
       €50              │            $22
                        │        ● Reelables
                        │            $25
                    LOW PRICE
```

**Direct Competitor: Reelables** — similar price, but:
- We have 180+ country coverage vs ~100
- We have 60-day battery vs 30-45 days
- We focus on China→EU/US (different market)

**Our Edge:** Best coverage + battery + AI route intelligence for international shipments

---

## Slide 9: Go-to-Market

### Founder-Led → Scalable Channels

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):**
- Founder network (China manufacturing)
- Amazon seller communities
- LinkedIn outreach
- Content/SEO

**Phase 2 (Months 7-18):**
- Paid acquisition (Google, LinkedIn)
- Freight forwarder partnerships
- Cargo platform / freight forwarder SaaS integration
- API integrations
- Trade shows

**Why Google + LinkedIn:**
- **Google Ads** — captures high-intent buyers searching "cargo tracker", "shipment tracking label" (bottom-of-funnel, measurable CAC)
- **LinkedIn** — targets B2B decision makers (importers, supply chain managers) who match our ICP directly

**Target:** 500+ customers, $440K revenue in Year 1

| **Labels Sold** | 20,000 | 50,000 | 200,000 |
| **Customers** | 500+ | 2,000 | 8,000 |
| **Gross Margin** | 50% | 61% | 63% |
| **Net Income** | $(50K) | $223K | $1.85M |

**Y1→Y2 growth drivers:** Scaled paid acquisition ($120K vs $100K), repeat orders from Y1 base (40% retention), first case studies accelerating sales cycles

**Break-even:** Q3 2026 (monthly), 2027 (annual)

## A4b: Why We Win vs Reelables (The #1 Investor Question)

**Reelables** is our most direct competitor. Here's our honest take:

| Factor | Reelables | TIP | Winner |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Price | $20-30 | $20-25 | **TIP** (slightly cheaper) |
| Battery | 30-45 days | 60+ days | **TIP** |
| Coverage | ~100 countries | 180+ countries | **TIP** |
| Intelligence | None | AI route detection | **TIP** |
| Focus | US domestic | China→EU/US international | **Different markets** |
| Funding | Seed stage | Seed stage | Tie |

**Our Strategy:**
1. **Don't compete head-on:** Focus on China export corridor (they focus US domestic)
2. **Win on specs:** 60-day battery and 180+ coverage matter for international
3. **Founder advantage:** CEO has 12 years in Shenzhen, direct access to shippers and suppliers
4. **If they enter our market:** Compete on support, relationships, and COGS efficiency

**Bottom line:** We're not claiming to be better than Reelables everywhere. We're claiming to be better for *international shipments from China*.

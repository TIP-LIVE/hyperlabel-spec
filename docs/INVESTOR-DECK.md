## Slide 1: Title

# TIP

### Track Any Cargo, Anywhere

**$20 Smart Tracking Labels for the $18B Cargo Visibility Market**

*Seed Round: $250K*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### $15B Lost Annually to Cargo Blind Spots

**The Pain:**
- 68% of SMB shippers report limited or no visibility during international transit (Freightos SMB Survey 2024)
- Cargo goes "dark" during flights, ocean transit, and remote areas
- Current solutions cost $100-500 per device

**The Quote:**
> "I ship $50K worth of electronics from China. My forwarder updates me every 3-4 days. If something goes wrong, I find out too late."
> — Amazon FBA Seller

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### A $20 Tracking Label That Just Works

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| $200+ tracker | $22 label |
| Bulky device | 3.5mm thin |
| Complex setup | Scan, peel, stick |
| Carrier-dependent | 180+ countries |

**How it works:**
```
Buy → Peel & Stick → Track Anywhere → Confirm Delivery
```

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity

### $18B Market, Underserved SMB Segment

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **TAM** | $18B | MarketsandMarkets 2024 |
| **SAM** | $1.8B | SMB segment (10% of TAM) |
| **SOM Year 1** | $125K | 5,500 labels sold |
| **SOM Year 3** | $2.55M | 100,000 labels |

**Why Now:**
- eSIM costs down 60-70% since 2020 (GSMA)
- LTE Cat-1 coverage: 180+ countries
- 47% of supply chain leaders prioritize visibility (Gartner 2023)

---

## Slide 6: Business Model

### Hardware Sales with Expanding Margins

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| ASP | $22.73 | $25.54 |
| COGS/label | $12.00 | $7.80 |
| **Gross Margin** | **47%** | **69%** |

**Margin improvement drivers:**
- Manufacturing volume: 5.5K → 100K labels
- eSIM tiered pricing
- Shipping negotiation

**Unit Economics (Year 3):**
- CAC: $88
- LTV: $350 (single-order) / $750+ (with repeat purchases*)
- LTV:CAC: **4.0x** (single-order) / **8.5x** (with repeat*)

*\*Conservative repeat assumption: 1.5 orders/customer/year, 2-year lifespan*

                    LOW PRICE
```

**Direct Competitor: Reelables** — same price, but:
- We have 180+ country coverage vs ~100
- We have 60-day battery vs 30-45 days
- We focus on China→EU/US (different market)

**Our Edge:** Best coverage + battery for international shipments

## A4b: Why We Win vs Reelables (The #1 Investor Question)

**Reelables** is our most direct competitor. Here's our honest take:

| Factor | Reelables | TIP | Winner |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Price | $15-25 | $20-25 | Tie (comparable) |
| Battery | 30-45 days | 60+ days | **TIP** |
| Coverage | ~100 countries | 180+ countries | **TIP** |
| Focus | US domestic | China→EU/US international | **Different markets** |
| Funding | Seed stage | Seed stage | Tie |

**Our Strategy:**
1. **Don't compete head-on:** Focus on China export corridor (they focus US domestic)
2. **Win on specs:** 60-day battery and 180+ coverage matter for international
3. **Founder advantage:** CEO lives in Shenzhen, direct access to shippers
4. **If they enter our market:** Compete on support, relationships, and COGS efficiency

**Bottom line:** We're not claiming to be better than Reelables everywhere. We're claiming to be better for *international shipments from China*.
